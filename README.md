# Task-1: Creating an python program to encrypt and decrypt the text using Caesar Cipher Algorithm.

The *Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption Tool* is a Python based tool that encrypts and decrypts text using the **Caesar cipher algorithm**. Users can input a message and enter an shift value to perform encryption or decryption. The tool preserves letter case and non-alphabetic characters, making it easy to use for basic cryptographic applications.
